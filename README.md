# Universities-and-Industries-Collaboration-system
Web-based application to Collaborate with Universities and industries using Java Servlet, JSP, JavaScript, Html, CSS, JDBC, MySQL.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In Sri Lanka all the industry and university collaboration are done by traditional ad hoc manner, where it doesnâ€™t have any specifications and common  procedures to follow.<p> And the collaboration is defined within guest lectures, industry visits and workshops. Therefore, there is a very good demanded need for a system to take place which can be used easily by both the industry as well as the universities those who are seeking for opportunities. <p>
<p>The system should compromise of two main portraits, one is for the industry and the other one is for the universities. Changes in above mentioned portraits should be reflected to each other in real time. <p>

<p>The requirements include:<p>
   
<ul>
<li>Manage industry login</li>
<li>Manage university login</li>
<li>Send queries to the industry from university portrait</li>
<li>Share university academic calendar and event calendar with industry </li>
<li>Post events from industry portrait</li>
<li>Make comments on posts from university portrait</li>
<li>Good looking interactive environment</li>
<li>User friendliness</li>
</ul>  
<ul>
<p>As IT undergraduates we designed web application which connected to a database, having capabilities of all requirements.<p>
 <h2>Problems with the existing manual system</h2>
<li>No proper indication of timing and events.</li>
<li>Some events may overlap since there is no administration.</li>
<li>Changes may not be reflected properly.</li>
<li>Some universities may not get the message on time.</li>
<li>Variation between message send and message received.</li>
</ul>  
<ul>
<h2>Expected benefits from our application</h2>
<li>All details will be saved in the database real time</li>
<li>No need to worry about the security of data</li>
<li>Easy to access and use</li>
<li>Realtime reflection on changes</li>
<li>Accuracy is very high</li>
</ul>
